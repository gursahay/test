Out of the night that covers me
Black as the pit from pole to pole 
I thank whateer gods maybe
for my unconquerable soul

in the fell clutch of circumstance
i have not winced nor cried aloud
under the bludgegoings of chance
my head is bloody but unbowed

beyond this place of wrath and tears
looms but the horror of thee shade
yet the menace of the years
finds and shall find me unafraid

it matters not how straight the gate
how charges with punishment the scroll
i am the master of my fate
i am the captain of my soul
